# Introduction 

This was made for a tutorial - and it is highly opinionated. If you are someone who agrees with convention over configuration - you might love this. 

Motivation behind this project 
* Aggregate the best standard practices out there related to terraform and ansible and build a teplate on top of them.
* Create a starter template using which anyone can quickly get started with setting up and managing their infra on AWS/Azure 

Goals
* Decrease turn-around time for setting up your first Virtual machine on cloud
* Avoid the manual work of setting up your machine 
* Serve as a good reference for anyone who would want to understand how Infrastructure as code and/or Config as code can be done easily.
